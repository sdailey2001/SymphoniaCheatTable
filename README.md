# Symphonia Cheat Table
I decided to create a cheat table that would be easy to update and will work for the latest TSFix version.

Requires Cheat Engine v7.5

This currently features:
- Title & Costume Tool
- Equipment Tool (Currently only Weapons)
- Item Tool (Consumables/Materials/Equipment/Ingredients/Key Items)
- Artes Tool
- Artes Sphere v1.1

(Made 2nd Artes Page Empty instead of Copying the First Page and Fixed a Crash When There Wasn't At Least 4 Party Members)

(Unable to Change Strats While Artes Sphere is Active. I still need to find an address for the Artes Menu. (. _ . ) )
- Free Running (By: U4ick)
- Name Fixes [EN] (e.g. Indignation Judg., Tech --> Artes, Holy Binds --> Shining Bind, Ax --> Axe, ect.)
