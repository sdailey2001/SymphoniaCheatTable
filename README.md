# Symphonia Cheat Table
I decided to create a cheat table that would be easy to update and will work for the latest TSFix version.

Required:
- Cheat Engine v7.5
- TSFix

This currently features:
- Title & Costume Tool (Want to look stylish while have the best title for stats?)
- Equipment Tool (Currently only Weapons)
- Item Tool (Consumables/Materials/Equipment/Ingredients/Key Items)
- Artes Tool (Able to Swap Artes)
- Artes Sphere Scipt v2.0 (Finally!) (Activate by Holding [LB] in Battle; In Artes Menu Press [Select])

[NOTICE] Create a Seperate Save if you plan to use the Arte Sphere!

(Artes now save per file, but I am unsure if any event flags will be messed up!)

(You can change Strategies again, but anything that causes pauses (Like Spells) will allow you to swap the Strategy mid-gameplay.)

(Unison still requires each person to hold [LB] to use their Alt Artes. That's some true teamwork!)

- Free Running (By: u4ick)
- Name Fixes [EN] (e.g. Indignation Judg., Tech --> Artes, Holy Binds --> Shining Bind, Ax --> Axe, ect.)
