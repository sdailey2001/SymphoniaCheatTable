# Symphonia Cheat Table
I decided to create a cheat table that would be easy to update and will work for the latest TSFix version.

Requires Cheat Engine v7.5

This currently features:
- Title & Costume Tool
- Equipment Tool (Currently only Weapons)
- Item Tool (Consumables/Materials/Equipment/Ingredients/Key Items)
- Artes Tool
- Artes Sphere v1.1 (Activate by Holding [LB]. You have to Hold it to Change Artes in the Menu.)

[NOTICE] Artes will NOT save on reboot. You will have to reassign them each boot.

(Made 2nd Artes Page Empty Start Empty and Fixed a Crash That Would Occur if There Was Less Than 4 Party Members)

(Unable to Change Strats While Artes Sphere is Active. I still need to find an address for the Artes Menu.) (. _ . )

- Free Running (By: u4ick)
- Name Fixes [EN] (e.g. Indignation Judg., Tech --> Artes, Holy Binds --> Shining Bind, Ax --> Axe, ect.)
